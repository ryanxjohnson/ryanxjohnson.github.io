            <title>Where to Start</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;As a new developer, it’s slightly overwhelming to pick a certain area to focus and develop skills. With the availability of new technology growing rapidly, I’m like a kid in a toy store - except the toys are more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In college, we not only learned Computer Science theory, but engaged with current technology and created technology. In once Software Engineering course, we even had a real customer with real system requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to become exposed to many technologies in a short time frame, which I have done. Now it’s up to me to determine my path. How can I best contribute to the tech world? Is it embedded software, back-end database design, software architecture, or even UI? Should I focus on Web Applications or Mobile friendly? Should I involve hardware into my creations or strictly software? I consider myself more middle-ware and front-end design, but I’m not discounting any particular area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the questions I’m pondering as I determine what’s best for me and the larger technology community.&lt;/p&gt;
