As a new grad, it's slightly overwhelming to pick a technology and become an expert in it. Not only are there many technologies, but the complexity and relevance of each differs. I appreciate the things tech can do, and I'm determined to find out what I can do. I'm like a kid in a toy store, but the toys are complex and will shoot you in the foot.

In college, we not only learned Computer Science theory, but engaged with current technology and created technology. In one Software Engineering course, we even had a real customer with real system requirements.

It's easy to become exposed to many technologies in a short time frame, which I have done. Now it's up to me to determine my path. How can I best contribute to the tech world? Is it embedded software, back-end database design, software architecture, or even UI? Should I focus on Web Applications or Mobile friendly? Should I involve hardware into my creations or strictly software? 

I'll keep up with learning while I am looking for my first developer job.
