As a new developer, it's slightly overwhelming to pick a certain area to focus and develop skills. With the availability of new technology growing rapidly, I'm like a kid in a toy store - except the toys are more complex.

In college, we not only learned Computer Science theory, but engaged with current technology and created technology. In once Software Engineering course, we even had a real customer with real system requirements.

It's easy to become exposed to many technologies in a short time frame, which I have done. Now it's up to me to determine my path. How can I best contribute to the tech world? Is it embedded software, back-end database design, software architecture, or even UI? Should I focus on Web Applications or Mobile friendly? Should I involve hardware into my creations or strictly software? I consider myself more middle-ware and front-end design, but I'm not discounting any particular area.

These are the questions I'm pondering as I determine what's best for me and the larger technology community.
