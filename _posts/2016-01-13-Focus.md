We have 24 hours in a day. Everything we'd like to accomplish has to be done in those 24 hours. This includes day-to-day activities like our chores, going to our jobs, and spending time with family and friends. We also have to consider the overhead planning for finances, meals, etc. Also, we'd like to workout, read, work on our hobbies too, so we get stretched thin. We barely have time to be lazy! I'm speaking from the perspective of a married man with no kids, so I should have a ton of free time, right?

I like to improve on the things I have in my life. But if I worked to improve every little aspect, I wouldn't be gaining that much because of all the switching, so it's important that I focus on the things that are important to me and let the rest go on cruise control.

I have a pretty great job, and I'd like to get better at it. I can improve by many methods and the given is the experience I'll gain as a software developer at work. Yet, there are tangible things I can do to drive me forward. I can read books, work on personal projects, and teach someone else how to write computer code.

My software development goals for 2016 are to read at least 2 software engineering related books, have a working prototype of a software-related project, and teach at least 1 person the basics of writing computer code.
